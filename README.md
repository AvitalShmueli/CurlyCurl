# CurlyCurl

Final project for Android Application Development course, in Afeka - the academic college of Engineering in Tel Aviv.

## Overview

CurlyCurl is an application for curly people(both women and men) who would like to share their opinions and recommendations on different hair products,
their routines and advices and trade hair products that didn't “curl” for them in a give-and-take marketplace.
The application was developed using Java.
